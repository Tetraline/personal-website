      I'm learning web development. Here I present some projects and some
      writing.
    </p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>These were developed while following the Odin Project course?</p>

    <h1>Writing</h1>
    <p>
      The writing published here is some of my thoughts on designing for the web
      and the skills important for software engineering.
